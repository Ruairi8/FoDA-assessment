## Description
I explored 5 topics in Jupyter Notebooks as part of continuous assessment for Fundamentals of Data Analytics. I also explored the normal distribution and part of a project for this module.

## How to Run Jupyter
Jupyter Notebook is an interactive environment for writing and running code. The Notebook in my repository is linked with the iPython kernel and therefore runs Python code. Code cells allow users to run code by clicking 'shift-enter'or by clicking the â–¶ button in the toolbar. 'ctrl-enter' runs a selected cell and enters command mode. The Kernel is used to manage running of the code, it can be restarted to nullify all cell outputs or interrupted.

Installation documentation for Jupyter can be found, on [ReadTheDocs](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install.html). More advanced usage of Jupyter notebook can be found [here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

For a local installation, it can be installed via pip by running:
``` python
pip install notebook
```
Jupyter is launched with in a local installation:
``` python
jupyter notebook
```
Or for running a Jupyter notebook remotely you need some configuration. See [Running a notebook server](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/public_server.html).
